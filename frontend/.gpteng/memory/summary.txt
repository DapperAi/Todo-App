Current State:
After the latest iteration, the application has seen improvements in user interface aesthetics and usability. Specifically, the `UserProfile.tsx` component was updated to enhance the visual appeal and readability of the user profile section. This was achieved by centering the user's avatar and username horizontally using Tailwind CSS classes and improving the username's font size, weight, and color for better visibility. These changes contribute to a more engaging and user-friendly interface, complementing the application's robust task management and security features.
