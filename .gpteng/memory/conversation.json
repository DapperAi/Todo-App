[{"user": "You are tasked with building a simple task management application. The application will allow users to create, update, and delete tasks. Tasks should have a title, description, and a status (e.g., \"To Do,\" \"In Progress,\" \"Done\"). Users should also be able to view a list of tasks and filter them by status.\r\n\r\nFront-End Requirements:\r\n\r\nUser Interface: Create a user-friendly interface for the task management application. It should have atleast the following components:\r\n\r\nA form to create a new task with fields for title, description, and status.\r\nA list of tasks with the ability to update the status or delete a task.\r\nA filter or dropdown to filter tasks by status (e.g., \"All,\" \"To Do,\" \"In Progress,\" \"Done\").\r\nYou can be creative in adding additional features here.\r\n\r\nUser Experience: Implement smooth and responsive user interactions, including form validation to ensure that tasks cannot be created without a title.\r\n\r\nStyling: Use tailwind css for styeling\r\nResponsive Design: Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.", "ai": "#### Planning\n\nTo build the task management application, we need to create several components and update existing files to include the necessary functionality and styling. Here's a step-by-step plan for the changes:\n\n1. **Create a New Task Form Component**: This component will include input fields for the task title, description, and a dropdown for the task status. It will also have a submit button. This component will handle form validation to ensure the title is not empty.\n\n2. **Create a Task List Component**: This component will display a list of tasks. Each task will show the title, description, and status. It will also include buttons to update the status and delete the task.\n\n3. **Create a Task Filter Component**: This component will be a dropdown that allows users to filter tasks by their status (\"All,\" \"To Do,\" \"In Progress,\" \"Done\").\n\n4. **Update App Component**: The `App.tsx` file will be updated to include the new task form, task list, and task filter components. It will manage the state of tasks and pass necessary props to child components.\n\n5. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS to style the components for a user-friendly interface and ensure responsiveness.\n\n6. **Update `code_description.toml`**: Add descriptions for the new components created.\n\n#### Generate diffs\n\n```diff\n--- /dev/null\n+++

Task Updating: Users can update the status of tasks.\n4. Task Deletion: Allows users to delete tasks they no longer need.\n5. Task Filtering: Users can filter tasks based on their status (All, To Do, In Progress, Done).\n\nCurrent State:\nAfter the last iteration, the application now includes a New Task Form Component for adding tasks, a Task List Component for displaying tasks, and a Task Filter Component for filtering tasks by status. The App Component has been updated to integrate these new components, and Tailwind CSS has been used for styling. The code changes have successfully implemented the planned features, making the application fully functional with a user-friendly interface.\n"}]
