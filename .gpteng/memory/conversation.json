Each task will show the title, description, and status. It will also include buttons to update the status and delete the task.\n\n3. **Create a Task Filter Component**: This component will be a dropdown that allows users to filter tasks by their status (\"All,\" \"To Do,\" \"In Progress,\" \"Done\").\n\n4. **Update App Component**: The `App.tsx` file will be updated to include the new task form, task list, and task filter components. It will manage the state of tasks and pass necessary props to child components.\n\n5. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS to style the components for a user-friendly interface and ensure

This discrepancy in expected and provided types is causing the TypeScript error.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to adjust how we're handling the `value` prop for the `DatePicker` component. Instead of directly passing the `dueDate` state variable, which is of type `Date | null`, we should convert it to a string format that the `DatePicker` can accept, or ensure it's `undefined` when `dueDate` is `null`. However, upon reviewing the `react-datepicker` documentation and types, it's clear that `react-datepicker` actually expects a `Date` object or `null` for its `selected` prop, not `value`. This seems to be a misunderstanding of the component's API. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the `selected` prop instead of `value` and pass the `dueDate` directly to it, as it correctly handles `Date | null`.\n\nHere's the plan to fix the error:\n1.
