Application Summary Document

Description:
The application is a task management tool that helps users efficiently organize, track, and manage their tasks. It offers a user-friendly interface for task creation, viewing, updating, deletion, and filtering, enhancing productivity and task management.

Main Features:
1. Task Creation: Users can add new tasks with details like title, description, and status.
2. Task Viewing: Provides a list view of all tasks with essential details.
3. Task Updating: Enables the modification of task details, including status.
4. Task Deletion: Allows users to delete tasks that are no longer needed.
5. Task Filtering: Supports filtering tasks based on their status for better organization.

Current State:
The application has recently been improved for accessibility by adding `aria-label` attributes to input and select elements in the `NewTaskForm.tsx` and `TaskFilter.tsx` components. This update ensures all form elements are accessible, with labels like "Task Title", "Task Description", "Task Status", and "Filter Tasks By Status". These enhancements, along with the integration of new components for task entry, viewing, and filtering, and the application of Tailwind CSS for styling, have made the application fully functional, more accessible, and user-friendly.
