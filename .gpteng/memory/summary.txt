Application Summary Document

Description:
The application is a task management tool that helps users efficiently organize and manage their tasks. It now features enhanced data persistence, ensuring that tasks remain available even after a page refresh, thanks to the use of browser's localStorage.

Main Features:
1. Task Creation: Users can add new tasks with a title, description, and status.
2. Task Persistence: Tasks are now saved to and loaded from the browser's localStorage, preventing data loss on page refresh.
3. Task Listing and Management: View all tasks, with options to update their status or delete them directly from the interface.
4. Task Filtering: Users can filter tasks by their status, improving task organization and visibility.

Current State:
The application has been significantly improved in the last iteration by implementing data persistence using localStorage. This ensures that tasks data is retained across page reloads, addressing the issue of data vanishing upon refreshing the page. The changes include:
- Serialization and deserialization of tasks data for storage in localStorage.
- Initialization of the tasks state with data loaded from localStorage upon application load.
- Utility functions for localStorage operations to maintain clean and maintainable code.
These enhancements have made the application more reliable and user-friendly, providing a seamless task management experience.
