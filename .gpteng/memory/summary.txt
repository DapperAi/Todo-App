Application Summary Document

Description:
The application is a task management system designed to help users efficiently organize and track their tasks. It has been enhanced to ensure secure and dynamic updates of tasks based on the logged-in user's actions, leveraging JWT for authentication.

Main Features:
1. Real-Time Task Updates: Supports immediate synchronization of task updates with the backend.
2. Secure User Authentication: Utilizes JWT for secure user identification and task updates.
3. Comprehensive Task Management: Enables creating, updating, and deleting tasks with backend synchronization.
4. Personalized User Experience: Customizes task management based on the logged-in user's profile.
5. Enhanced Security: Implements improved error handling for secure and reliable task updates.

Current State:
The application now securely identifies users through JWT tokens instead of request body parameters for task updates. This change enhances security by ensuring that tasks are updated based on the authenticated user's email extracted from the JWT token. The system now provides a more secure, efficient, and user-centric task management experience.
