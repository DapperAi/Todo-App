Application Summary Document

Description:
The application is a comprehensive task management tool designed to assist users in organizing and tracking their tasks with ease. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as filtering them based on their current status.

Main Features:
1. Task Creation: Enables users to add new tasks by specifying a title, description, and status.
2. Task Viewing: Displays a list of tasks with details such as title, description, and status.
3. Task Updating: Allows users to modify the status of their tasks as needed.
4. Task Deletion: Users can remove tasks that are no longer necessary.
5. Task Filtering: Offers the ability to filter tasks by their status (All, To Do, In Progress, Done).

Current State:
Following the latest iteration, the application has been enhanced with the addition of a New Task Form Component for task entry, a Task List Component for presenting tasks, and a Task Filter Component for status-based filtering. The App Component integrates these new features seamlessly. The recent code adjustments, including the removal of unrecognized props from the `NewTaskForm.tsx` file, have rectified errors and contributed to the application's functionality and user experience. The use of Tailwind CSS for styling further improves the interface, making the application fully operational and more user-friendly.
