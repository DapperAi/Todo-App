Current State:
After the last iteration, the application now includes a functional task filter, allowing users to display tasks based on their status. This was achieved by introducing a new state variable for the filter value, modifying the `TaskFilter` component to update this variable, and updating the task rendering logic to filter tasks accordingly. These changes have significantly improved the application's usability by enabling users to easily manage and view tasks based on their completion status.
