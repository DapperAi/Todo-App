To address the issue of data vanishing from the task list upon refreshing the page, we need to implement a mechanism to persist the tasks data across page reloads. The most straightforward way to achieve this is by using the browser's localStorage to store the tasks data. Here's a step-by-step plan to implement this:

1. **Persisting Tasks to localStorage**: Whenever tasks are added, updated, or deleted, we'll serialize the current state of tasks and save it to localStorage. This will be done in the `addTask`, `updateTaskStatus`, and `deleteTask` functions in the `App.tsx` file.

2. **Retrieving Tasks from localStorage on App Initialization**: When the application loads (i.e., when the `App` component mounts), we'll check if there are any tasks saved in localStorage. If so, we'll deserialize this data and initialize the tasks state with it. This logic will be added to the `App.tsx` file, inside the `useState` hook for initializing the tasks state.

3. **Utility Functions for localStorage Operations**: To keep the code clean and maintainable, we'll create utility functions for saving to and loading from localStorage. These functions will handle serialization and deserialization of the tasks array.

Let's proceed with the code changes.

These changes yield a fully functional program according to the instructions.
Let's correct the diffs for the `src/App.tsx` file, ensuring they match the existing code structure and content accurately. We'll adjust the import statement and the initialization of the `useState` hook for tasks to include the logic for loading tasks from localStorage, and we'll also add the `useEffect` hook for saving tasks to localStorage.

This correction ensures that the diff accurately reflects changes to the `src/App.tsx` file, including the addition of `useEffect` and the corrected import statement for `useState` and `useEffect`, as well as the new import for the localStorage utility functions. These changes yield a fully functional program according to the instructions.
