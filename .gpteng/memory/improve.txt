To resolve the error you're encountering with `react-datepicker` in the `NewTaskForm.tsx` file, it appears that the `value` prop of the `DatePicker` component is expecting a `string` or `undefined`, but is being provided with a `Date` object or `null`. This discrepancy in expected and provided types is causing the TypeScript error.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust how we're handling the `value` prop for the `DatePicker` component. Instead of directly passing the `dueDate` state variable, which is of type `Date | null`, we should convert it to a string format that the `DatePicker` can accept, or ensure it's `undefined` when `dueDate` is `null`. However, upon reviewing the `react-datepicker` documentation and types, it's clear that `react-datepicker` actually expects a `Date` object or `null` for its `selected` prop, not `value`. This seems to be a misunderstanding of the component's API. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the `selected` prop instead of `value` and pass the `dueDate` directly to it, as it correctly handles `Date | null`.

Here's the plan to fix the error:
1. Replace the `value` prop with the `selected` prop in the `DatePicker` component.
2. Pass the `dueDate` state variable directly to the `selected` prop without any conversion, as `react-datepicker`'s `selected` prop is designed to accept `Date | null`.

Let's implement these changes:
