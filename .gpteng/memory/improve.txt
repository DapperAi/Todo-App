To beautify the logout button, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Location of the Logout Button**: First, we need to identify where the logout button is implemented in the application. Since the logout functionality was mentioned as a recent addition, it's likely part of a component that handles user authentication or user profile management. However, the provided code does not explicitly show a logout button, so we will assume it's part of the `UserAuth.tsx` component for demonstration purposes.

2. **Update the Button Styling**: We will use the `@nextui-org/react` library's `Button` component to ensure consistency with the rest of the application's design. We will customize the button's appearance by adjusting its properties such as `color`, `size`, and possibly adding an icon for visual appeal. We will also use Tailwind CSS for additional styling if needed.

3. **Add a Logout Icon**: To make the button more intuitive, we can add a logout icon. The `@nextui-org/react` library might not have direct support for icons in the `Button` component, so we will use an SVG icon or an icon from a popular library like `react-icons`.

4. **Ensure Accessibility**: It's important to ensure that the button is accessible, including proper labeling for screen readers.

Since the exact location and implementation of the logout button are not provided, the following changes are based on the assumption that it would be added to the `UserAuth.tsx` component for demonstration purposes.
